# Randomfunbot
Discord bot created for personal server.
Purpose is to create a bot that can do various actions on certain probablilities for fun. e.g deleting messges, adding random reactons and other things.
Uses node to locally host the bot for use on the server.

Hoping to add:
	
Expanding the loot boxes

adding a way to 'equip' and display what is pulled from boxes

reworking of the coin system to make them worth more
