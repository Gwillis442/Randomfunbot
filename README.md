# Randomfunbot
Discord bot created for personal server
Purpose is to create a bot that can do various actions on certain probablilities for fun
E.g deleting messges, adding random reactons and other things
Uses node to locally host the bot for use on the server. Currently looking into a cloud hosting service to run 24/7

Hoping to add:
  Russian Roulett mode
  '/' commands to change different variables including specific usernames, probabilities and to use other functions
  Web hosted rather then locally
  More fun random events 
  Random number generator 
  more ways to screw with 'Kony911'
